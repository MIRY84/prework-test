# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project to analyse the technical aspects of each of the languages: such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
As Front End Web Developer I must master these languages to be able to effectively and efficiently deliver a succesful website.
I sorted some debugs problems encountered and learnt the basis and strategies to fulfil the aim of a cohesive project .


## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

As you navigate in the website through Chrome Dev Tool you can use the commands as Console to check all the sections of the languages and topics.
From the Sources section you will be able to see and scroll down my files and the codes in there.

I hope you enjoy it as I did!
